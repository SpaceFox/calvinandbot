Ignoring the control tower's protests, Calvin guns the engines and passes the other planes, cutting across less crowded runways!  Rounding a corner, he opens the throttle! Stewardesses explaining the aircraft's safety features are hurled to the rear of the plane by the sudden acceleration!  All the other planes watch with envy as Calvin takes off ahead of schedule! But what's this?!  Another plane had already received clearance to land!  It's headed for the same runway!  It looks like a mid-air collision over a crowded super highway at rush hour! Oh, what a price to pay for his hurry!  Mom:  I'm back!  Thanks for waiting so patiently.  Calvin:  I could wait even longer if you'd buy me a third plane. ",
